This is also the place to find generators and such that bundle KeystoneJS.\n\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you can, please contribute by reporting issues, discussing ideas, or submitting pull requests with patches and new features. We do our best to respond to all issues and pull requests within a day or two, and make patch releases to npm regularly.\n\nIf you're going to contribute code, please follow our [coding standards](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/wiki/Coding-Standards) and read our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Usage\n\n**Check out the [KeystoneJS Getting Started Guide](http://keystonejs.com/getting-started) to start using KeystoneJS.**\n\n### Installation\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Keystone is to use the Yeoman generator:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g generator-keystone\n$ yo keystone\n```\n\nAnswer the questions, and the generator will create a new project based on the options you select, and install the required packages from **npm**.\n\nAlternatively, to include Keystone in an existing project or start from scratch (without Yeoman), specify `keystone: \"^0.3.9\"` in the `dependencies` array of your `package.json` file, and run `npm install` from your terminal.\n\nThen read through the [Documentation](http://keystonejs.com/docs) and the [Example Projects](http://keystonejs.com/examples) to understand how to use it.\n\n\n### Example application script (keystone.js)\n\nRunning in default mode, Keystone takes care of everything required to configure your application with Express, connect to your MongoDB database, and start the web server.\n\nHere is an example of what your `keystone.js` (or `app.js`, etc) file may look like:\n\n```js\nvar keystone = require('keystone');\n\nkeystone.init({\n\n\t'name': 'My Project',\n\t'brand': 'Project',\n\n\t'less': 'public',\n\t'static': 'public',\n\n\t'views': 'templates/views',\n\t'view engine': 'jade',\n\n\t'auth': true,\n\t'user model': 'User',\n\t'cookie secret': '--- your secret ---',\n\n\t'auto update': true\n\n});\n\nkeystone.import('models');\n\nkeystone.set('routes', require('./routes'));\n\nkeystone.start();\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nConfig variables can be passed in an object to the `keystone.init` method, or can be set any time before `keystone.start` is\ncalled using `keystone.set(key, value)`. This allows for a more flexible order of execution (e.g. if you refer to Lists in your\nroutes, you can set the routes after configuring your Lists, as in the example above).\n\nSee the [KeystoneJS configuration documentation](http://keystonejs.com/docs/configuration) for details and examples of the available\nconfiguration options.\n\nTo understand how these settings are used, and how the Express application is initialised, see `Keystone.prototype.start` in `lib/core/start.js`.\n\n\n### Database field types\n\nKeystone builds on the basic data types provided by mongo and allows you to easily add rich,\nfunctional fields to your application's models.\n\nYou get helper methods on your models for dealing with each field type easily (such as\nformatting a date or number, resizing an image, getting an array of the available options\nfor a select field, or using Google's Places API to improve addresses) as well as a beautiful,\nresponsive admin UI to edit your data with.\n\nSee the [KeystoneJS database documentation](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database) for details and examples of the various field types,\nas well as how to set up and use database models in your application.\n\nKeystone's field types include:\n\n*\t[Boolean](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-boolean)\n*\t[Color](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-color)\n*\t[Date](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-date)\n*\t[Datetime](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-datetime)\n*\t[Email](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-email)\n*\t[Html](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-html)\n*\t[Key](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-key)\n*\t[Location](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-location)\n*\t[Markdown](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-markdown)\n*\t[Money](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-money)\n*\t[Name](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-name)\n*\t[Number](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-number)\n*\t[Password](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-password)\n*\t[Select](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-select)\n*\t[Text](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-text)\n*\t[Textarea](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-textarea)\n*\t[Url](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-url)\n*\t[Azure File](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-azurefile)  \n*\t[CloudinaryImage](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-cloudinaryimage)\n*\t[CloudinaryImages](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-cloudinaryimages)\n*\t[Embedly](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-embedly)\n*\t[LocalFile](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-localfile)\n*\t[S3 File](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/#fieldtypes-s3file)\n\nKeystone also has [Relationship fields](http://keystonejs.com/docs/database#relationships) for managing one-to-many and many-to-many\nrelationships between different models.\n\n\n### Running KeystoneJS in Production\n\nWhen you deploy your KeystoneJS app to production, be sure to set your `ENV` environment variable to `production`.\nYou can do this by setting `NODE_ENV=production` in your `.env` file, which gets handled by [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).\n\nSetting your environment enables certain features, including template caching, simpler error reporting and html minification, that are important in production but annoying in development.\n\n\n### Linking Keystone for Development and Testing\n\nIf you want to test or develop against the `master` branch of KeystoneJS (or against your own branch), rather than a published version on **npm**, you just need to check it out then use `npm link` to link it to your project. On Mac OS, this is done like this:\n\n*\tCheckout KeystoneJS locally, e.g. to `~/Development/KeystoneJS`\n*\tFrom the KeystoneJS directory, run `sudo npm link` (you will need to enter your system password)\n*\tFrom your project directory, e.g. `~/Development/MySite` (the one with your `package.json` file in it) run `npm link keystone`. This will create a link between `~/Development/MySite/node_modules/keystone` and `~/Development/KeystoneJS`.\n\nThen `require('keystone')` normally in your app - the development copy will be used. Note that running `npm update` will ignore new versions of keystone that have been published.\n\nTo go back to using a published version of KeystoneJS from npm, from your project directory, run `npm unlink keystone` then `npm install`.\n\n#### Testing\nTo run the test suite run `npm test`.\n\n\n## Thanks\n\nKeystoneJS is a free and open source community-driven project.
